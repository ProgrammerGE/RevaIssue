        Here's what needs to be done:
        1) Div that shows the users
          a) This will be scrollable
          b) It holds <a> elements that represent users. Clicking removes them (for now)
            i) Must get all users from that project using the user service
        2) Div that holds the admin button(s)
          a) Button to add user. Makes a popup come up, showing a scrollable menu of all users
            i) Must get all users.
            ii) Search bar for quick adding.

    This space is reserved for a two things:

    First is the issues browser pane. It shows the projects issues. Users can click on them
    to be taken to a page where they can view that issue's details. Testers have a button
    to create issues.

    Second is the quick description pane. It shows the description of the issue that
    is currently being hovered over

     TODO: First add the issues table, then add the issue quick description.
